# Computed Values Demo - Example from the original request
# Shows how to use computed values from value providers

# Get the current strip length
set strip_len = strip_length()

# Create animation with computed values
animation stream1 = comet_animation(
  color=red
  tail_length=abs(strip_len / 4)  # computed value
  speed=1.5
  priority=10
)

# More complex computed values
set base_speed = 2.0
animation stream2 = comet_animation(
  color=blue
  tail_length=strip_len / 8 + (2 * strip_len) -10  # computed with addition
  speed=base_speed * 1.5         # computed with multiplication
  direction=-1
  priority=5
)

# Property assignment with computed values
stream1.tail_length = strip_len / 5
stream2.opacity = strip_len * 4

# Run both animations
run stream1
run stream2
